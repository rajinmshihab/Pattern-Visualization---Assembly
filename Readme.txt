You must use a assembly programming IDE to run this program (eg. GUI Turbo Assembler, DOSBOX)



Assume, you are currently working as algorithm designer for APU Event Management Unit and you need to apply an appropriate mathematical logic to design shapes. This will be useful for the APU Event Management Unit to propose new designs in the digital banners or digital arch for the events/festivals. 
You, as programmer in APU Event Management Unit, required to develop an assembly program to design digital display banner/arch using registers, services, flow control statements and procedures/macros for the above-mentioned case study using TASM and TLINK. The design should be precise and clear with the above given shapes also need to include minimum 5 lines of text to be displayed and permitted to use various colours for making attractive digital banner/arch. Research and analyse the significance of reverse engineering in image steganography and describe the usage of IDA Pro tool.
